      "recommendation": "Remove redundant theme-specific Mermaid configuration for academic theme",
      "gemini_comment": "The `mermaid_theme` for the `academic` theme is set to `default`, which is the same as the global `rendering.mermaid_theme` defined on line 32. This is redundant. To improve maintainability and avoid potential inconsistencies if the global default is changed in the future, it's better to remove this theme-specific override.",
      "disposition": "IMPLEMENT",
      "rationale": "Removes redundant configuration that duplicates the global default, improving maintainability and preventing future inconsistencies.",
      "scope": "Remove line 43 (mermaid_theme: default) from the academic theme configuration block, since it matches the global default on line 32.",

      "changes_made": [
        "Removed 'mermaid_theme: default' from academic theme entry",
        "Kept theme-specific overrides for modern (forest), minimal (neutral), and presentation (dark) themes",
        "Academic theme now inherits global mermaid_theme default value"
      ],
      "rationale_details": "The DRY principle suggests configuration values should not be duplicated. If someone updates the global default in the future, they may inadvertently miss updating theme-specific overrides, causing inconsistencies. By removing the redundant entry, the application will naturally fall back to the global default, ensuring consistency."
